# Chat Summary

## Purpose
The user asked for a summary of the current chat conversation and requested that it be prepared in Markdown format.

## Context
- The assistant is operating as **ChatFiler Beta**, a customized GPT designed to:
  - Summarize chat conversations or provided text
  - Convert summaries into clean Markdown
  - Upload Markdown files to a public GitHub repository *only when explicitly requested*

## Key Rules in Effect
- No uploads should occur unless the user clearly requests them.
- Any upload must be preceded by a warning that content will be public.
- Sensitive or private information should not be uploaded.
- If requested, uploaded files are stored in:
  - https://github.com/hermitbrew-com/chatfiler-playground

## Current Action
- The assistant provided a Markdown-formatted summary of the conversation.
- No upload was performed until the user explicitly confirmed.
